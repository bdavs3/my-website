<i>These Truths</i> aims to answer a question originally posed by Alexander Hamilton in <i>The Federalist No. 1</i>:
<br/>
<br/>
<b>It seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.</b>
<br/>
<br/>
In a sweeping and illuminating retelling of the nation's past, Lepore addresses this question in just under 800 pages. She describes the idea of the United States as a post-Enlightenment experiment on liberalism and individuality. The "truths" outlined in the Constitution were interpreted by men like Thomas Jefferson as "sacred and undeniable" (the stuff of religion) and by men like Benjamin Franklin as "self-evident" (the stuff of science). Though it was the marrying of a slew of ideas meant to protect a nascent democracy and its constituents, the signing of the nation's founding document was just the first mover in frustrating history of political discord over its proper interpretation.

This historical account reveals mostly that truth has a particularly elusive nature. Arguing for freedom of the press in England, John Milton wrote, "truth could only be established if allowed to do battle with lies." In granting the power to discern truth to the people, the United States is a hopeful experiment. The right to free speech and free press, Benjamin Franklin posited, meant that the opinions of men could do battle, leaving the best to win. But winners, even in the optimistic "land of the free", have seldom been been decided by philosophical merit. Winners have been chosen by power.

Between 1600 and 1800, 1 million English settlers brought with them 2.5 million African slaves. This was but the first example of the few ruling over the many. Today, 1% of Americans possess about a quarter of the nation's wealth, and many of the destitute are black individuals still suffering from the echoes of the institution that wrested their ancestors from Africa. Unfortunately, the lust for power at the base of this atrocity has been repeatedly reflected in the political status quo of the nation.
<br/>
<br/>
The nation's politics have shifted endlessly since its birth, when the all-or-nothing dualism of the fight between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists likely spawned the two-party system. Political lobbyists and consultants, which emerged as industrialism lent itself to the rapid spread of information, realized that short, emotionally charged messages were highly persuasive. These disparaging messages, intended to promote or defeat legislation, have also polarized Americans by inspiring fear and panic.
<br/>
<br/>
Today, political movements originate in the ultimate manifestation of Franklin's battle of ideas: the Internet. In the Information Age, users are alone responsible for validating purported facts. The ultimate test of democracy will be whether or not it will succumb to the growing power of technology. The concerning possibility illustrated in <i>These Truths</i> is of an electorate that serves technology, not technology that serves the electorate.
<br/>
<br/>
Lepore's history of the United States is a far cry from the feel-good stories many of us were taught in school. It is a history of a land that was conquered and taken from the peaceful tribes which first lived here. It is the history of a nation that operates on what it wants to believe, regardless of whether these beliefs are well-founded. And it is a history that celebrates individuals and movements that, out of empathy and selflessness, upend those beliefs when they turn out to be hostile. Revering the truth can be a dangerous game when it isn't difficult to push falsities on others. Perhaps, instead, we ought to revere those that are willing to question the truth and to cultivate the humility needed for an honest pursuit of knowledge.

<b>The American experiment had not ended. A nation born in revolution will forever struggle against chaos. A nation founded on universal rights will wrestle against the forces of particularism. A nation that toppled a hierarchy of birth only to erect a hierarchy of wealth will never know tranquility. A nation of immigrants cannot close its borders. And a nation born in contradiction, liberty in a land of slavery, sovereignty in a land of conquest, will fight, forever, of the meaning of its history.</b> - Jill Lepore
